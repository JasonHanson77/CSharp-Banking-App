# CSharp-Banking-App
A mock up of a basic banking account application written in C#.

This is a basic windows console application that implements a set of fee rules using dependency injection based on the type of bank account of the account holder.  The three types of bank accounts are: Free, Basic, and Premium.

The solution consists of three different implementations of the app using different dependency injection solutions: Factory Design Pattern, Unity Framework, and Ninject.

Accounts are saved to text files and there is also an in-memory repo for unit testing with NUNIT.
